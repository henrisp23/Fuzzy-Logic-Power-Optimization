1. Data written in the csv files is just dummy data, in reality i want to use solar-powered car to record for the inputs
2. FuzzyPowerOptimization.ipynb contains full code using python language
3. FuzzyLogicPowerOptimisation.pdf contains detail informations about full code
4. FuzzyPowerOutput.png is visualisation of final results
